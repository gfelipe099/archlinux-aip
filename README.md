# archlinux-aip
The Arch Linux's Automated Installation Procedure tool (testing branch)

## What is this?
This is a utility which will setup Arch Linux from terminal to a desktop for you.

Feel free to fork it and make your own configuration.

Also, the only supported desktop enviroment is GNOME, for now.

## How can I get started?
I do not recommend to use this branch. You will only find incomplete and unusable script updates.
